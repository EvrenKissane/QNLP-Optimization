**<h1>Quantum Natural Language Processing Optimization Research</h1>**
**<h2>Instructions</h2>**
For running the code, you will need Python 3.7 or later, and you will need to make `discopy` compatible with `jax` by setting `IMPORT_JAX = True` in discopy's `config.py`. 

**<h2>Introduction</h2>**
<ol>
  <li><b>Motivation:</b> This project explores the application of quantum natural language processing (QNLP) to the task of sentence classification. Traditional natural language processing (NLP) often faces challenges in handling the complexities of language, particularly with ambiguous grammatical structures and long-range dependencies. QNLP offers a potential advantage by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to represent and process linguistic information in new ways.</li>
  <li><b>Objectives:</b> The primary objective of this project is to build and evaluate a QML model that can classify sentences into predefined categories. Specifically, we focus on a binary classification task, where sentences need to be classified as either belonging to class 1 or class 0. We aim to investigate the feasibility of using quantum circuits to encode and process pregroup grammar representations of sentences, and to use these representations for classification.</li>
  <li><b>Quantum Advantage:</b> Quantum machine learning is explored for this task due to its potential advantages in:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Encoding:</b> Quantum states can represent high-dimensional feature spaces efficiently, potentially better capturing the complex relationships in language.</li>
      <li><b>Parallelism:</b> Quantum algorithms can explore multiple possibilities simultaneously, potentially leading to faster training and inference.</li>
      <li><b>Expressability:</b> Quantum circuits have the potential to represent more complex functions than classical neural networks, enabling the model to learn intricate linguistic patterns.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**<h2>Methods</h2>**
<ol>
  <li><b>Framework:</b> This project utilizes DisCoPy, a Python library for diagrammatic reasoning, alongside Qiskit, a framework for quantum computing. Pytket is employed for quantum circuit optimization and backend interaction.</li>
  <li><b>Model Architecture:</b> Here is a high-level overview of the model:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Pregroup Grammar:</b> Input sentences are parsed into diagrams representing their grammatical structure using a pregroup grammar.</li>
      <li><b>Diagram Transformation:</b> The diagrams are transformed to prepare for the quantum encoding by "bending nouns around" to simplify the circuit structure.</li>
      <li><b>Quantum Encoding:</b> DisCoPy's CircuitFunctor is used to map the transformed diagrams to quantum circuits. Each word in the sentence is encoded using parameterized quantum circuits, primarily based on IQP ansatz with learnable parameters.</li>
      <li><b>Measurement and Classification:</b> Measurement of the final quantum state provides a probability distribution, used for binary classification.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Quantum Circuit:</b> The core of the model is a quantum circuit built from DisCoPy's pregroup grammar diagrams. Each word is represented by a parametrized quantum gate or circuit. The specific structure depends on the sentence's grammatical structure. The circuits are then measured to obtain a probability distribution used for sentence classification.</li>
</ol>

**<h2>Dataset and Preprocessing</h2>**
<ol>
  <li><b>Data Description:</b> The project utilizes an English, 130-sentence dataset categorizing sentences related to food or IT for binary classification. The data is split into training, development, and test sets. The dataset comprises sentences with specific grammatical structures, including 'N_TV_N', 'N_TV_ADJ_N', 'ADJ_N_TV_N', and 'ADJ_N_TV_ADJ_N'.
  </li>
  <li>The preprocessing steps include:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Tokenization:</b> Sentences are split into individual words.</li>
      <li><b>Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:</b> Words are tagged with their grammatical roles (noun, verb, adjective).</li>
      <li><b>Pregroup Grammar Conversion:</b> Sentences are represented as pregroup grammar diagrams.</li>
      <li><b>Diagram Transformation:</b> Pregroup grammar diagrams are transformed ("bending nouns around") for better quantum circuit construction.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**<h2>Results</h2>**
<ol>
  <li><b>Simulation:</b> The experiments were conducted using the AerBackend, a local quantum simulator provided by Qiskit. This choice allowed for rapid experimentation and model development before potential deployment on actual quantum hardware. While the use of a simulator facilitates faster evaluation, it's important to note that the performance on actual QPUs might vary due to noise and other quantum effects.</li>
  <li><b>Key Findings:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Achieved a 20% increase in training accuracy and a 30% increase in testing accuracy compared to the standard SPSA algorithm across all tested ansatzes.</li>
      <li>Demonstrated the effectiveness of proposed ansatzes (Sim14.1 and Sim15.1) and training algorithms on a binary classification task (MC dataset with 130 sentences classified as food or IT).</li>
      <li>Validated the improved SPSA, ADAM optimizer, and genetic algorithms for parameter optimization, showing reduced error rates during training and testing phases.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Performance Metrics:</b> </li>
    <ol>
      <li>Cost Function:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Measures the negative average cross-entropy across the training dataset.</li>
          <li>A lower cost indicates better optimization.</li>
        </ol>
      <li>Training Error:</li>
        <ol>

          <li>A lower training error reflects better model performance during training.</li>
        </ol>
      <li>Development (Dev) Error:</li>
        <ol>

          <li>Used to evaluate the model's generalization capability.</li>
        </ol>
      <li>Testing Error:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Calculated as the percentage of incorrect predictions on the testing dataset.</li>
          <li>Indicates the final model accuracy on unseen data.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
</ol>
